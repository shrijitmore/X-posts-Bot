# Twitter Bot Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

✅ **AI Tweet Generation**: Fixed Google Gemini API integration
✅ **Twitter API Integration**: Improved error handling and credential validation  
✅ **Database Logic**: Fixed issue where failed tweets were being saved to database
✅ **Error Handling**: Added better error messages for common issues

## Quick Setup

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env
   ```

2. **Configure your API keys in `.env`:**
   - **Twitter API**: Get credentials from [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
   - **Google Gemini**: Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - **Supabase**: Get credentials from [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. AI Service Issues
- Fixed incorrect Google GenAI API usage
- Updated to use proper `@google/generative-ai` package
- Added better error handling for API key issues

### 2. Database Saving Logic
- Failed tweets due to missing API keys are no longer saved to database
- Only legitimate failures (rate limits, content issues) are logged
- Prevents database clutter from configuration issues

### 3. Error Handling
- Added specific error messages for common issues:
  - Missing API keys
  - Invalid credentials
  - Rate limit exceeded
  - Content safety filters

### 4. Configuration
- Created `env.template` file with all required environment variables
- Application now provides clear feedback when running in demo mode

## Current Status

The application should now:
- ✅ Provide clear error messages when API keys are missing
- ✅ Not save failed tweets to database when due to configuration issues
- ✅ Work properly when all API keys are configured
- ✅ Handle rate limits and other API errors gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Set up your API keys in the `.env` file
2. Test the application with a simple tweet
3. Check the logs for any remaining issues

The bot is now ready for production use once properly configured!
